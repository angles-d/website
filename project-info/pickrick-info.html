                        <p>The Pickrick Protests project is an interactive location-based AR installation that recreates the Pickrick Protests that occured on what is now Georgia Tech's Campus. </p>
                        <p>In 1965 after the passing of the Civil Rights Act, three African American activists, Charles
                            Wells, Albert Dunn, and Woodrow Willis, were denied entry to a the Pickrick restaurant. The
                            restaurant was owned by Lester Maddox, a segregationist and future governor of Georgia. In
                            following protests by the activists, Maddox reacted violently shouting and pushing them away
                            from the restaurant entrance. These events became the basis of the first law suit filed
                            under the Civil Rights act by Constance Baker Motley.</p>
                        <p> The Pickrick Restaurant was later purchased by Georgia Tech when it closed down. In 2008 the
                            restaurant was demolished to build a new greenspace, the EcoCommons</p>

                            <iframe class="embed-responsive-item pl-4 pr-4" src="/img/pickrick/demo.mp4"
                                allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        </div>

                        <p>This project uses AR storytelling to turn the invisible visible. By projecting a model of the
                            original restaurant and animations of the protesters themselves, we are able to restore
                            context to the location despite all physical traces of the event having disappeared. The
                            location based nature allows the user to walk around in the space and stand next to the
                            activists as they face a white mob of Maddox supporters during their non-violent protest.
                        </p>
                        <p>By leveraging the unique media format of AR, the project aims to remove the narrative away
                            from the usual protagonist, Lester Maddox, and bring these protesters into the foreground
