                        <p>The Pickrick Protests project is an interactive location-based AR installation that recreates
                            the 1965 Atlanta Pickrick Protests. </p>
                        <p>After the passing of the Civil Rights Act, three African American activists, Charles
                            Wells, Albert Dunn, and Woodrow Willis, were denied entry to the Pickrick restaurant. This
                            restaurant was owned by Lester Maddox, a segregationist and future governor of Georgia. In
                            following protests by the activists, Maddox responded with violence preventing them from
                            entering the restaurant. These events became the basis for the one of the first law suits
                            filed
                            under the Civil Rights act by the NAACP.</p>
                        <p> The Pickrick Restaurant was later purchased by Georgia Tech when it closed down. In 2008 the
                            restaurant was demolished to build a new greenspace, the EcoCommons</p>

                            <iframe class="embed-responsive-item pl-4 pr-4" src=".././img/pickrick/demo.mp4"
                                allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        </div>

                        <p> By projecting a model of the original restaurant and animations of the protesters on the GT
                            EcoCommons, we are able to restore context to the location despite all the physical traces of the event having disappeared. The location-tracking within the app allows the user to explore the space and see all sides of the story. They can stand next to the activists as they face a white mob of Maddox supporters and also see what it feels like to be part of the mob as well. This project aims to use AR storytelling to highlight these relatively unknown activists and turn the location's invisible history visible once more.
