                            <p>The McCloud Pyramid is an representation of Scott McCloud's "Big Triangle" of visual
                                meaning in Mozilla's virtual environment, hubs.
                            </p>

                            <p class="mb-0">The three forms of meaning within the pyramid: text, reality, and abstract. The forms of
                                meaning can blend together creating intermediate forms of reality. To represent
                                these forms we use a face as the base object. As the user moves across the room, the
                                face model morphs from one form of meaning to the other with each corner representing a
                                form of reality.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For instance, if the user starts at "abstract" they are faced with the a sphere as they
                                transition towards the corner for "reality" the model slowly morphs into a realistic
                                face. This progression was achieved creating the transition with shapekeys in Blender
                                then using morph-targets in Three.js to perform the realtime morphing.
                            </p>

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                As the project progressed, additional intermediate steps were added into the path to better reflect McCloud's "Big Triangle". For instance, in the transition from text to reality, intermediate models such as emoticons and emojis were added between the starting word "face" and the final realistic face.
