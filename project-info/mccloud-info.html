                            <p>The McCloud Pyramid project is an interactive VR representation of Scott McCloud's "Big
                                Triangle" of visual
                                meaning made in Mozilla Hubs.
                            </p>

                            <p class="mb-0">There three forms of visual meaning within the triangle: text, reality, and
                                abstract. These forms can be merged together to create intermediate forms of reality. To represent
                                these forms we used a face as the base object. As the user moves across the room, the
                                face model morphs from one form of meaning to the other with each corner of the pyramid representing a new
                                form of reality.
                            </p>

                            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                                <img class="col-9  mb-4 img-fluid" src="./../img/mccloud/meaning-map.png">
                            </div>

                            <p>
                                For instance, if the user starts at the "abstract" corner, they see a sphere model. As they
                                move towards the "reality" corner the model slowly morphs into a realistic
                                face. This progression was achieved by creating the transition with shapekeys in Blender and
                                then using morph-targets in Three.js to perform the realtime morphing.
                            </p>
                            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                                <img class="mt-2 mb-4" src="./../img/mccloud/morphing.gif">
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                As the project progressed, additional intermediate steps were added into the path to
                                better reflect McCloud's "Big Triangle". For instance, in the transition from text to
                                reality, intermediate models such as emoticons and emojis were added between the model of the text "face" and the final realistic face.
                            </p>
