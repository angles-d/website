                        <p>In 1965, three non-violent African American activists, Charles Wells, Albert Dunn, and Woodrow Willis, were denied entry to a restaurant owned by a segregationist future governor of Georgia, Lester Maddox, after the Civil Rights Act passed. During the confrontation, Maddox violently pushed the activists away from the property and shouted at them. The restaurant where the confrontation happened, the Pickrick Restaurant, was later purchased by Georgia Tech when it closed down.</p>

                        <p>In this experience,  the interactor is readily immersed by impersonating one of the activists. The violent acts of Lester Maddox, the Pickrick restaurant, and the protestors who stood against them are concretely presented, and the interactor is challenged to behave non-violently when facing the aggressive confrontation. </p>
